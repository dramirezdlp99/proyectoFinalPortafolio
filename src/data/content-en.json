From epic video games like God of War and Marvel's Spider-Man, to cinema —where 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' with Jim Carrey is my favorite—. Music is also fundamental: I listen to everything, but my heart beats with rock/metal from Avenged Sevenfold and rap from Eminem. In sports, I follow Real Madrid, admire CR7, and enjoy basketball with Luka Doncic and tennis with Sinner. These passions keep me creative and balanced.",

This experience taught me discipline, management, and the importance of solving real problems —skills I apply today in every software project I develop.",

My path wasn't linear: in 2019 I started Architecture, but soon discovered that my true passion was in code, not blueprints. Since childhood I was skilled with computers, and today I combine academic learning with constant practice, video tutorials, and AI tool support. My favorite stack includes Java, Spring Boot, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB. I prefer Windows for now, but dream of working on Mac to further enhance my workflow.",

I studied at Escuela Normal Superior and Instituto Técnico COLSUP, where I forged friendships I still maintain. My united family and close environment are my daily fuel. Every project I develop, every line of code I write, carries a part of them. This portfolio isn't just mine: it's a reflection of their unconditional support.",
